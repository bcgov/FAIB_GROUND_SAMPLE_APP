## **Sample Types**

#### **Plot types with generalized coordinates**
Generalized coordinates are provided for the three plot types that make up the Provincial Monitoring Program so that unbiased change on the landscape can be monitored over time. 

##### **Change Monitoring Inventory (CMI) plots**
> <font size = "2.5">Provide statistically-sound, point-in-time and change estimates of vegetation attributes in mature stands (>50 years old) over existing sampled areas of the province with fixed-radius plots located on the 20 km by 20 km NFI grid.</font>

##### **Young Stand Monitoring (YSM) plots**
> <font size = "2.5"> Monitor the growth and health of young (15-50 years old) stands using fixed-radius plots located on an intensification of the 20 km by 20 km NFI grid.</font>

##### **National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots**
> <font size = "2.5"> A stratified subset of CMI plots that have been selected across national Ecozone boundaries and that contribute towards Canada's National Forest Inventory program.</font>

##### **Supplemental Samples (SUP) plots**
> <font size = "2.5"> Samples on a 10*20km grid across the mature population.</font>

#### **Plot types with actual coordinates**
Actual coordinates are provided for the active and inactive PSPs and for the VRI plots. 

##### **Permanent Sample Plots (PSP)**
> <font size = "2.5"> Subjectively located fixed-area permanent plots, valued for their long-term re-measurement data to support development of growth-and-yield models in unmanaged stands across a range of stand and ecosystem types. Also referred to as Growth and Yield (GY) plots.</font>

##### **Vegetation Resource Inventory (VRI) plots**
> <font size = "2.5"> Temporary 5-point cluster plots used to audit and/or adjust photo-interpreted spatial inventory attributes, sampled from area-specific project implementation plans. Also referred to as VRI-phase II ground plots.</font>
